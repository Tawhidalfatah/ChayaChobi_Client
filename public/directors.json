The film's better if the period is a day or a week or fortnight or a month, so that nobody grows up: everybody's as they were in the beginning.”",

But with a bad script even a good director can't possibly make a good film. For truly cinematic expression, the camera and the microphone must be able to cross both fire and water. The script must be something that has the power to do this.”",
